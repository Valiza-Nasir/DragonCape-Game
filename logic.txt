1-Understanding


First of all we need to understand its flow which is random emoji's generators and random flag generators.
There are two players may be one is computer or otherone is a user or may be both players are users.
There are four rows in each line and eight columns when each flag in one row or each emoji in each row match may be  its one player or 
second player then game ends and player wins.We need to understand the logic of drag and drop how can we drag a div
and drop into another div.


2-Logic Start
Step.1
 I will generate random emojis using Math.random method
 Step.2
 I wiil generate random flags using Math.random method
 Step.3
 Use Mobx store to manage states of the users
 Step.5
 Make Arrows on the top of each row
 Step.6
 when we click on arrow the first row images shift their position and take the position of the next images
 Step 7.
 The last image take the position of the one image which is stored in states
 Step 8.
 Match the each row with their index to the second row with their index and with third row with their index and
 with forth row with their index if all matches that player win we show a alert and game ended
